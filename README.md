# Hyperledger-BanList

A simple business network built with:
* Hyperledger Fabric
* Hyperledger Composer
* Yeoman
## Setup
If you're running on Ubuntu, you can download the prerequisites using the following commands:
```
curl -O https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/v0.19/prereqs-ubuntu.sh
chmod u+x prereqs-ubuntu.sh
```
Next run the script - as this briefly uses sudo during its execution, you will be prompted for your password.
```
./prereqs-ubuntu.sh
```
